# Movies iOS Application

‚ö†Ô∏è This pet project is still under development. I create this project mainly to practice TDD and testing skills. You can also clone the project to see how I use TDD to build features.

‚ö†Ô∏è This project uses APIs from: https://www.themoviedb.org/ 

‚ö†Ô∏è travis ci is not working anymore due to out of credits üòû . I'll try to use another CI server soon.
